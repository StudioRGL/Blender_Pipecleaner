# Blender_Pipecleaner
Experimental addon for Blender, allowing the construction of 3D "pipecleaner" models from 2D grease pencil strokes



## Todo

- [x] add sort function to clusters
- [x] implement cluster-based population
- [x] add arbitrary planes support
- [ ] make sure it works with colinear points (or rather, fails gracefully)
- [ ] make proper averaging for arbitrary planes?
- [ ] deal with locked/hidden layers? what should it do? maybe ignore locked layers, but not hidden layers?
- [ ] doesn't always seem to reliably deal with intersections?
- [ ] deal correctly with cyclic strokes?
- [ ] add materials generation
- [ ] add operator for 'generate materials'
- [ ] add operator for 'set strokes below threshold to intersectionMarkers'
- [ ] add operator for 'generate'
- [ ] add menu/ui
- [ ] add addon stuff
- [ ] position intersection markers in 3D space?
